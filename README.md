# NBA Draft Picker/Lotto Ball puller

This was a small pair-programming project written during a short afternoon.

The project was developed with Travis Way (TravisWay).

The project was initially designed to simulate a NBA draft using the rules that are laid out by the NBA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery). It was then refactored to take in the rules of the national lottery powerball framework.
